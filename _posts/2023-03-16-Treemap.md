## Introduction:

<p>Treemap is widely used to visualize hierarchical data structure, they are like network data that do not have dependent relationships within the dataset. A hierarchical data structure has a root entity and then the root entity has at least one “child node” and every further child node has zero or more children. It is commonly used in politics, organizational role structure and geography of countries, and many others. These types of data are mostly visualized using Treemap or sunburst charts.</p>

## A History of Treemap:

<p>In response to the common problem of a filled hard disk, the **number of files and folders on the hard disk** increased almost exponentially. Dr. Ben Shneiderman became obsessed with the idea of producing a compact visualization of directory tree structures. It was difficult to determine how and where space was used. Finding large files that could be deleted, or even determining which users consumed the largest shares of disk space were difficult tasks. </p>

<p>while solving this issue, other more common visualization methods did not work well.    For example, the folder structure on a computer is a tree structure containing folders, subfolders, and each folder has too many files. The traditional tree-structured diagram is too large and hard to visualize.</p>
<p>So he created the treemap to visualize hierarchical data. He wanted "a compact visualization of directory tree structures".So he explored ways to show a tree in a space-constrained layout. Below is the image of the Linux kernel file structure, we can easily see the file structures and the space occupied by each folder and subfolders in a simple way</p>
### The Linux Kernel Treemap
![The Linux Kernel Treemap](/assets/img/post_imgs/Treemap_visualization/kernel-2.5.33.png)

<p>Martin Wattenberg created a slight variation on this, which Dr. Shneiderman referred to as a clustered treemap. This design is what most people today commonly refer to as a treemap.</p>

## How to read/view Treemap:

<p>The root directory is the whole rectangle and then it is split into several directories, each being a contained rectangle. The process is repeated recursively to the leaves (the files here). Rectangles are laid out to be as square as possible within an interactive computation time. The different sizes of rectangles are proportional to the size of their content.</p>
<p>Treemaps not only show value hierarchy by splitting the whole area into smaller rectangle pieces but also show value relations by obtaining rectangles of different sizes within each split category. we could see patterns within them. Colors fade when going deeper in the hierarchy. The deepest hierarchy seems to be in the arch subdirectory. we can quickly identify the larger and small components.</p>

## Treemap for categorical comparisons:

![Blog post of popularity Treemap](/assets/img/post_imgs/Treemap_visualization/example1.jpg)

<p>we can use treemap to visualize categorical data, there are often a lot of categorical data in the dataset, treemap can be used to easily compare these large numbers of categories visually. we cannot use other charts like bar charts here we can show the top category and group rest category as others to provide better visualization but it doesn't describe all data in a dataset.</p>

## Treemap in Practice:

<p>Consider the following dataset(dummy data only for demo) with a hierarchical data structure among its columns/features. These features or variables (or columns) can have a parent or child relationship with other columns.</p>

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go

election_data= {
 'state':[ 'INMP','INCG','INCG','INNY','INNY','INNY','INSD','INGD','INSF','INSA','INAS',
           'INHF','INSR','INCQ','INSF','INXO','INXO','INGD','INSD'],
 'city' : ['A1','B2','M1','C2','N1','O2','D1','E2','F1','G2','H1','I2','J1','K2','L3',
           'R1','Q1','S1','P1'],
 'vote' :[512,1220,9021,812,821,128,9104,132,82,5121,232,8841,10,236,1200,60,4120,6012,20],
 'party':['x','y','x','x','x','x','x','x','y','x','x','x','y','x','x','y','x','x','y']
 }

data = pd.DataFrame(election_data)
data.head()
```

<p>using Plotly we can draw the treemap, the parameter path is the way the tree is hierarchically arranged and we can change the order to form the different perspectives for categorical data. Value parameter takes the numerical value which determines the area of the rectangle how big it is based on numeric data here. color can be any column name in the dataset for comparisons.  for further refer Plotly official  documentation-</p>

```python
# Draw the figure
fig2 = px.treemap(data, path=['state','city','party'],
                  values = 'vote',color="party",
                  maxdepth =-1
                  )

# Set title and font size
fig2.update_layout(title=dict(text="election data",x=0.5),
                   title_font= dict(family = 'arial', size = 35),
                   font = dict(size = 25, family = 'Verdana'),
                   hovermode =False,
                   width  = 900, height = 900)
#fig1.write_image(path + 'TreeMap0.png')
fig2.data[0].textinfo = 'label+percent parent'
fig2.data[0].hovertemplate = '%{label}<br>%{percent entry}'
fig2.show()
```

<p>the color is based on the column party x is blue and y is red to identify the winning status
Notice that the blue is more than half of the entire treemap. This is easy to see, that party x  owns the election in a lot of cities and we could see city B2 decides differently and Party Y wins in B2. this treemap is just for quick comparing the categorical data with others </p>

<p>The above Treemap shows the top categories, devices, and age brackets for the year 2021. The size of the rectangles indicates the relative size of each category and the subgroup amount funded. Different colors and different color intensities show graduations of larger and smaller percent funded for that particular year: very bright color indicates a large amount funded among the groups.</p>
<p>we can easily find from the treemap the ios is the most used device compared with the size of the rectangle of both android and ios. In the same way age group, 18-24 is the group of people who funded the most.</p>
<p>But we cannot determine the top category where the funds are raised top two is  the sports and game category as they occupy most of the rectangle, the other three categories(technology, environment, fashion) is looking similar in size and is not clear to order in term of an area of a rectangle</p>

## The problems with treemaps

<p>The biggest problem with treemaps is that using size to encode the data makes it impossible to make precise quantitative comparisons. The limitation is that our eyes aren’t great a detecting relatively minor differences in either of these dimensions and colors.  In addition, treemaps are common chart types in many business intelligence tools, they are often being used to show simple categorical comparisons that would be better visualized as a bar chart. It is even difficult when it doesn't have a common baseline and it's a lot of work to understand the data, it shouldn't take minutes to understand the graph</p>
<p>we can use other charts if needed for precise comparisons like bar charts, dot plots, and line charts.</p>

## Conclusions

<p>Treemaps can be used for hierarchical or categorical data only when needed to make a  specific comparison. They are also used for a “part of a whole” analysis with non-hierarchical data. They should not be used to draw accurate conclusions, with negative quantitative data, or when numerical differences do not allow for proper comparison.</p>
